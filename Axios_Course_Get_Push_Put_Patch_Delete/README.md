Headers:
Headers are like tags on your request or response when your computer talks to a website. They carry important information, like what kind of data you're sending or receiving, if you're allowed to access a certain place, and more. Think of them as labels that help the computer on the other side understand and respond correctly.

Axios:
Axios is a helpful tool for your computer programs to talk to websites and get information. It's like a messenger that makes sure your requests and the responses from the website are understood and handled properly. Developers use Axios to make these conversations smooth and reliable.
